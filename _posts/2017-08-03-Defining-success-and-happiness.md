### Introduction

Another year has been added to my age. When I was young I can say my life was above
average. That time I never felt hungry or not having what I want. Maybe because
our family had a family business that can support our needs as a child. When you 
grew up and your mom or dad was running a business automatically you also feel 
like a boss whenever you visit the business that your parents own. Also that
was the reason I hate being commanded by someone because of my experiences as child.


### High School Life

Then I entered high school. That was time all those experiences changed. Mom and Dad
got seperated. I never knew that time what was the reason I never asked and let those thing past. 
At young age I've tried to distract myself from it by being addict on video games. Playing Ragnarok, Counter Strike, Flyff, Dota, PlayStation etc... as Dendi said <i>"One way to forget about pain is to do something you will be in, completely... So, computer games"</i>


### Five Years in College

Before I've entered college I finally got the reason why my mom decided to ditch my dad
because of several reasons regarding his second family. Both families are not legal.
Mom hated things that my dad did especially when the time my mom wanted to build
our future. Mom foresaw that if they continue their business we are not the one
who will be benefited from it and that is true. Things started to change, business
establishments(around 5 surplus) started to close one by one and the jeepneys(around 7-8) they own started to be put on sale. My dad never thought about our future. He only cares about his other
family. He never taught his children on that family on how to live, to do a living or even finished school. He just supported them with all the money that he and my mom saved.


I enter college without a single centavo came from him. My mom used her savings just to 
let me finish in a privilege school in college. There I was a time I needed to stop
studying and that time I got a half-scholarship to be enrolled for the next semester or it
will be invalid. I've stayed at home for one semester that's when I decided I needed to
learn something so I chose to learn programming. After my one semester break
I came back to study because mom got her money to support my tuition. That
time I don't want to waste any money so I make sure not to fail those subject I enrolled
and I kept all my allowances to give it back to my mom when she doesn't have any money.

### After College

Finally! after five long years on college without actually learning what 
I've wanted to learn which is programming. I am done studying now I can go to work!!! Job hunt everywhere! any job as long as I can give back to my family that supports me! After three months I got a job. A job that I hated the most Call Center Agent. I have no choice but to work but then I quit after a month because I really hate the job. After that It took a year before I land another job but wait... I did not make myself
a bum or being a cancer to society. I have a freelance programming job! well most of my clients are lazy students and they are willing to pay 7-10k per thesis but who cares about my job? as long as I am earning legally without doing illegal I am still active member of the society right?


### Official Job As A Programmer

By the time I got a job, I am so proud of myself and everytime I saw my father on my way to work
I looked him in the eyes and saw what man I had become. That is why I always put my best in work.
<br> <br>
Being a noob in the first company I've worked for. I needed two years before I finally figured it out that
I do not belong to that company but still... it taught me many things. Before I left the company, my dad passed away. I thought our problems with him will be gone. He did create another problem especially to me to solved.
It makes me hate him even more. Until his last days in this world he still chose those lazy bastards instead of us who have a dream and goals in life. When he was alive those bastards leeching him all the
savings he got then he died. Now those bastards don't have anyone left to leech but us. So they decided
to make fraud statements to grab our only property left.


### Lowest Point In My Life

Civil and Criminal Cases has been filed by those bastards which they cannot proved that our house was owned only by our father. Yes they can say they maybe have rights... because that is not a conjugal property or they are not married. But the main point is both families were not legal and the property was both named to my father and mother. The money came from my auntie that was loaned by my mom to establish those business and to buy the property we have now. How can they prove something that in the first place they do not have? If only our justice system here in the philippines are strong and fast maybe then I do not have this kind of problems. This was all happening after I resigned from my job. All my savings I've got wasted to pay for an attorney just because of the problems that they have created.


Only time will tell when this things will be done. KARMA will be served to those people. What goes around comes around. There is a time for everything. Maybe after all of this and in the future I will looked back
and I can say that this is just a thing in the past that I had survived.
