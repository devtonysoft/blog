Today i've practiced using axios as an alternative for jQuery AJAX Http Request.
Soon I'm gonna integrate this axios module for my future project. Axios supports the Promise API. 
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. This is the first axios project i've create

### Why use jekyll?

I find it interesting because you don't have to create and setup a database
to create your own blog as web developer. Jekyll posts was created using static pages you just need a template by creating a new file.

For more information about how to setup your jekyll application and how to write a post please refer to this link :
