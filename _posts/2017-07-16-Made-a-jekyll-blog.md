I've made my first blog using an application called "jekyll". You can find more information about jekyll here by visiting this link <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll Website</a>. 


### Why use jekyll?

I find it interesting because you don't have to create and setup a database to create your own blog as web developer. Jekyll posts was created using static pages you just need a template by creating a new file. For more information about how to setup your jekyll application and how to write a post please refer to this link <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/" target="_blank">Jekyll Documentation</a>
