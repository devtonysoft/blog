I've made my first blog using an application called "jekyll". You can find more
information about jekyll here : 
<a href="{{ page.jekyll_website }}" target="_blank">Jekyll Website</a>. 


### Why use jekyll?

I find it interesting because you don't have to create and setup a database
to create your own blog as web developer. Jekyll posts was created using static pages you just need a template by creating a new file.

For more information about how to setup your jekyll application and how to write a post please refer to this link :
